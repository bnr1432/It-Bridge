HTML --
What is markup language?
why it is called markup language
we all know hyper text it means hyper link 

what is tag?
it is something we write in <> sings
the tag tells a web browser to display the text

HTML tags are case insensitive.

Save file using "" like "home.html"

Browser interprets the HTML and ignores the errors in the html

Empty tag:
Tag that does not have an end tag.

Container tag:
Tag will start with <> and close </>.

Comments: 
<!-- /// -->
<!-- something write here -->

Block level tags: Block level elements it will start on new line
Inline level tags: Inline level elements never begin on new lines

Attributes:
Inside tag we write color, size, face etc .
face is also used to for font style.
it will work on html4 not in hmtl5

IDE: Intergrated Development Environment


Hyperlink:
<a href=""
Intra page Hyperlink
<a name=""

img:
usemap: The usemap attribute is added to the <img> tag and links it to a <map> element.
The <map> element contains one or more <area> tags, each defining a clickable region within the image.

---04-03-25---

Table:
collection of rows and columns,
cellspacing means - space between two cells.
cellpadding means - space between inside the cell.
rowspan - It means add two cell data to one cell.
valign -  It used to add the text wherever you want.

Forms:
Form tag is used to create controls on the page.
&nbsp; - used to give space in html 

frameset:
The <frameset> element in HTML was used to divide a web page into multiple sections or frames


---05-03-25---

Div Tag:
It is Block level element
Takes the full width available by default.

Span Tag:
It is Inline level element
Does not start on a new line and only takes as much width as its content.

non semantic tags: div and Span

semantic tags:
A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both. 
semantic tagging is for machine not for humans

Forms:
vaildation
need required
autocomplete =off
autofocus - it means to focus particular filed ex: when we open webiste it show fill the details which one you selected
formaction - to submit the data to that form


 
---06-03-25---

novalidate - attribute is a boolean attribute
formnovalidate- No need to write anything in fields
Disabled - we cannot take focus
         - The value of a disabled field is not submitted with the form.
         - When you want to prevent user interaction with a form element based on a condition, like disabling a submit button until all fields are filled.

readonly - 
         - When you want to display data that users should see but not change, like a username or calculated values that need to be submitted.

multiple - we can multiple email id at one fields ex: abc@gmail.com,ssd@gmail.com

oninput - The oninput attribute in HTML is an event handler that triggers a JavaScript function or code every time the value of an input element changes.

audio/video:

autoplay - 
controls -
loop  - 
muted - 

CSS - Cascading style sheet

        There are three main ways to include CSS:

Inline CSS:-
Definition: CSS styles are applied directly to HTML elements using the style attribute.
Best For: Quick, one-time styles or testing.
Drawback: Not reusable and makes the HTML cluttered.
Ex:-
<h1 style="color: blue; font-size: 24px;">Welcome to My Website!</h1>

Internal CSS (Embedded CSS):-
Definition: CSS is included within the <style> tag inside the <head> section of the HTML document.
Best For: Styling a single HTML page.
Drawback: Cannot be reused across multiple pages.
Ex:-
<head>
    <title>Internal CSS Example</title>
    <style>
        body {
            background-color: #f0f0f0;
        }
        h1 {
            color: green;
        }
    </style>
</head>

External CSS:-
Definition: CSS is written in a separate .css file, which is linked to HTML using the <link> tag.
Best For: Large websites with multiple pages.
Drawback: Requires an additional file but keeps HTML clean and reusable.

Ex:-
<head>
    <title>External CSS Example</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>

style.css
body {
    background-color: #f0f0f0;
}
h1 {
    color: red;
}

Note : we can use custom tag also in html and also we can apply css to that tag also.
custom tag is not predefined tag user can create own tag.
ex:
<high> hello</high>

high{
        color: white;
}

text-align -
text-indent - 
text-decoration - 
text-transform - all letter will be captialize ,uppercase,lowercase
font-family -
font-style - 
font-size -
background-image - 
background-repeat - 

Rule in anchor tag:
a:visted
a:link
a:hover

C:\Nagii Files\IT Bridge\Week3\Mar6\Links\link.html -copy path
Week3\Mar6\Links\link.html --relavtive path

---07-03-25---

list-style-image:url(''); - to use bullet images
We can give two tags at same time use css

External Css : Maintainance
Help us in reusing the style in other HTML Files
The benfit is we can reuse that css file

 ---CSS Selectors--- 
COMMAND	                                    DESCRIPTION	                                                       SYNTAX

UNIVERSAL SELECTOR	                The CSS universal selector (*) matches elements of any type.                 {}
                                    When utilising @namespace, universal selectors
                                    can be namespaced.	

ID SELECTOR	                        The CSS ID selector matches an element based on the value of                 #id {}
                                    the element’s id attribute. This is what you'd use to refer 
                                    to that one-of-a-kind element with an id.	

CLASS SELECTOR	                    The CSS class selector matches elements based on the contents               .class {}
                                    of their class. 	

TYPE SELECTOR	                    It selects all elements of the given type within a document.                h1, h2 ,h3 {}
                                    In other words, the type selector in CSS matches components 
                                    based on their node names.	

ADJACENT SIBLING SELECTOR	        The adjacent sibling combinator (+) separates two selectors.                 h1 + p {}
                                    It comes right after the first element, and they're both children  
                                    of the same parent.	

CHILD SELECTOR	                    The child combinator (>) is placed between two CSS selectors.	            ul > li {}

GENERAL SIBLING SELECTOR	        Select all elements that follow the first element such that both            h1 ~ p {}
                                    are children of the same parent.

DESCENDANT SELECTOR	                Any selector with white space between two selectors without a               p a {}
                                    combinator.	

Declarations:

    h1{ color : blue; font-style : 20px;}
     |    |       |       |          |
Selector  |       |       |          |

Javascript : Javascript is a synchronous single-threaded language.
             - Synchronous : Execute code in a order it finish one command then move to next.
             - Single-Thread: It execute one line at a time.
It is used for client side validation.

Everything in Javascript happens inside an "Execution Context".

The execution Context have two Components in it.
 i) Memory ii) Code

        |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
        |         Memory                                |                   Code            |
        |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
        | All variable and functions are stored here    |  The code is executed one line at |
        | as key:value.                                 |   time.                           |
        | Ex : a =10;                                   |                                   |
        |                                               |                                   |
        | var i = 10 -- It is global scope              | Here it will perform and give code|
        | square() {...}                                | To back.                          |
        |                                               | Here again will create execution  |
        | AddTwoNumber() {....}                         | context for functions and let and |
        |                                               | const                             |

        |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
                                        Execution Context

<<<Hoisting>>>
Acessing the variable and function before their declarations or initialization is called Hoisting in Js"

Hoisting in JavaScript is the behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before execution.
Note:
Hoisting in JavaScript moves function declarations and variable declarations (but not their assignments) to the top of their scope before execution.

Variable Declarations (var) are Hoisted but not Assigned
console.log(x);  // ✅ Undefined (not an error)
var x = 10;
console.log(x);  // ✅ 10






Javascript is a lossely typed language or weakly typed language.

    -It means It does not attach the date types with the variables any date type can be stored in a vavable without declaring the  data type.If then later data type can be stored in the same variable later on.so, Js is a flexible it automatically assigns the data types to the variable
Ex:
    i = 10;           - Here we declare integer to the variable  of i 
    i = "Bnr";        - Here we assign again string to the variable of i 


<<<errors in Js:>>>
Reference Error: When Js Engine tries to find out a specific variable inside the memory space & you cannot access it.

Syntax Error : When their is some missing syntax(like missing declaration in case of const or redeclare let variable inside the same scope with same name) or undefined syntax.

Type Error : When you assign a different type value to a different type variable. Ex: If you reassign a value to a const variable.


strict variable : const>let>var


<<<Arrays>>>
The array is a collection of data items of the same type. In simple terms, it is a variable that
contains multiple values.

Syntax: var fruit = ["element1", "element2", "element3"];

Another syntax:   var cities = new Array();             ---Useful for dynamically sized arrays
        cities[0] = "Andhra";
        cities[1] = "Tirupati";
        cities[2] = "Kadapa";
        cities[3] = "Chittor";

---Method:---

concat                  Joins two or more arrays together.                                      concat()

indexOf                 Returns the index of the specified item from the array                  indexOf()

join                    Converts the array elements to a string                                 join()

pop                     Deletes the last element of the array.                                  pop()

reverse                 This method reverses the order of the array elements.                   reverse()

sort                    Sorts the array elements in a specified manner.                         sort()

toString                Converts the array elements to a string.                                toString()

valueOf                 returns the relevant Number Object holding the value of                 valueOf()
                        the argument passed

<<<String>>>
The string is a sequence of characters that is used for storing and managing text data.

---Method:---

charAt                Returns the character from the specified index.                            str.charAt(3)

concat                Joins two or more strings together.                                       str1.concat(str2)

index of              Returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified                str.indexOf('substr')
                      character from the string else -1 if not found.

match                 Searches a string for a match against a regular expression.               str.match(/(chapter \d+(\.\d)*)/i;)

replace               Searches a string for a match against a specified string or               str1.replace(str2)
                      char and returns a new string by replacing the specified values.

search                Searches a string against a specified value.                              str.search('term')

split                 Splits a string into an array consisting of substrings                    str.split('\n')

substring             Returns a substring of a string containing characters from the            str.substring(0,5)
                      specified indices.
                      We can start at one postion onwards Ex: Nagarjuna                         str.substring(3)  -- it will arjuna

tolowercase           To convert string lowercase or uppercase letters                          str.tolowercase() 
touppercase                                                                                     str.touppercase()

<<<Functions:>>>
A function in JavaScript is a reusable block of code designed to perform a specific task when called.

Whenever a function is called in the JavaScript, a new local execution context is created in two phases.
i) Memory allocation     ii)code Execution are stored on local memory

Global Scope:  All the code(var & fn()) which are not inside any other function is called global scope.

EX:
    var x =10;                                                  Here :- var x & fn abc is a global scope
    function abc(){                                                         var y & and fn cba are not in global scope
        var y =11;
        function cba(){

        }
    }

Undefined ::  Undefined is special keyword used as a placeholder to allocate some memory for the variables in the memory
              allocation phase.
              Undefined is used as a placeholder in the memory to a variable until the value is not  Assigned to that variable

NotDefied :: when there is no memory is allocated for a varibale & we try access it.

<<<Assignment:>>>
The electricity bill has to be paid before the 5th of every month. 
Write java script code that will prompt the user to enter the bill number and credit card number 
(assume that the site has secure payment gateway).  
If the date user pays the bill beyond 5th but before end of the month,
then a fine of Rs. 50 is added for each delayed day.  
  Compute the final bill and pop up the result to the user.
Example:+
If payng the bill on 4th  Feb --------
(Prompt)Enter the bill amount : 8700
Either : Your total bill is : 8700	- 4th  Feb 
If the current date is :25th Feb then the output should be :
Or : Your total bill after late fees is : 9750 	- 25th	 Feb

oninput – Triggers whenever the input value changes.
          Example: As you type in a text box, it fires continuously.

onclick – Fires when an element is clicked.
          Use case: Button clicks, toggling UI elements, etc.        

onblur – Fires when an element loses focus (you click away or tab out).
         Use case: Validate a field after the user finishes typing.

onfocus – Fires when an element gains focus (you click or tab into it).  
          Use case: Highlight the input or show a tip (e.g., "Enter your email").

onkeypress – Triggers when a key producing a printable character is pressed (deprecated in modern browsers).
            Example: Typing 'A' triggers it, but pressing 'Shift' won't.
onkeydown – Fires when any key is pressed down (including special keys like Shift, Enter, or Backspace).
            Happens before the key actually appears on the screen.
onkeyup – Fires when a key is released after being pressed.
          Great for checking the final input after typing.

rule: 
    down>press>up

Onchange-
Fires when the value of an input changes — but only after the user moves away (loses focus).

Feature	                    onchange            	            onblur
When it fires	        Only if value changes	                Always when losing focus
Input types	        Works on text, select, textarea	            Works on any input element
Common use      	Track user changes (e.g., dropdowns)	    Validate or clean up input after focus moves

If we set value = Nag 
if it clear and write Nag it will perform onchnage when it perform is when value changed

Type Converison:-
Here are two kinds of type conversions:
Explicit conversion (You do it manually)
Implicit conversion (JavaScript does it automatically)


Explicit-
let num = 123;
console.log(String(num)); // "123"
console.log(num.toString()); // "123"
let str = "456";
console.log(Number(str)); // 456

Implicit-
console.log("5" + 2);  // "52" (number becomes string)
console.log("5" - 2);  // 3 (string becomes number)
console.log("5" * 2);  // 10
console.log("5" / 2);  // 2.5


Regular expression:
A regular expression is a pattern used to match character combinations in strings.

Common Flags-
g — Global search (find all matches, not just the first).
i — Case insensitive.
m — Multi-line mode.

Basic Patterns-
. — Matches any single character.
\d — Matches digits (0-9).
\w — Matches alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and _).
\s — Matches whitespace.
^ — Matches the start of a string.
$ — Matches the end of a string.

Quantifiers-
+ — One or more times.
* — Zero or more times.
? — Optional (0 or 1 time).
{n} — Exactly n times.
{n,} — At least n times.
{n,m} — Between n and m times.

transform lets you apply 2D or 3D transformations to an element like:
translate() – Move
scale() – Resize
rotate() – Rotate
skew() – Slant
matrix() – Combine all in one

Syntax: transform: function(value);

Function	                What it does	                Example

translate()             	Moves element	                translate(50px, 100px)
scale()	                    Scales up/down	                scale(1.5)
rotate()	                Rotates (in deg)	            rotate(45deg)
skew()	                    Skews the element	            skew(10deg, 20deg)
matrix()	                Complex transform	            (Advanced)

Media Query:
A media query lets you apply CSS styles based on the device’s screen size, resolution, orientation, and more.

Module Exports: 

console.log(process.argv); in Node.js:
This line prints the command-line arguments passed when you run your Node.js program.
process is a global object in Node.js.
argv stands for Argument Vector — it's an array of command-line arguments.

console.log(process.env); in Node.js
This line prints all the environment variables available in your current system and Node.js environment.
Environment variables are key-value pairs used to configure your application without hardcoding sensitive data or settings.

{ 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' }
                'text/plain' → Show it as plain text
                'text/html' → Treat it like an HTML page
                'application/json' → Treat it like JSON data

Imagine a waiter in a restaurant. This waiter is:

Single-threaded: only one waiter (Node.js) to take orders and serve food.

Very efficient: he doesn’t wait for the chef (slow tasks like database, file I/O).

Instead, he takes your order → passes it to the kitchen → goes to the next customer.

When the food is ready, the kitchen notifies him, and he serves it.

Components in this analogy:
Restaurant	Node.js Equivalent
Waiter	Node.js main thread
Kitchen staff	Background workers (libuv, OS)
Customer request	Incoming HTTP request
Food ready alert	Callback/event loop

Express JS:-
Express Js is a nodejs framework .
Express is a web application framework that provides you  with a  simple API to build websites .

Real-Time Analogy for Express:-
Think of Express like a waiter in a restaurant:
The customer (browser) makes a request (asks for food).
The waiter (Express) takes the request to the kitchen (your server logic).
The waiter brings back the food (response) to the customer.

Route definition takes the following structure:
		app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER)
Where:
app is an instance of express.
METHOD is an HTTP request method, in lowercase.
PATH is a path on the server.
HANDLER is the function executed when the route is matched.

The most commonly used HTTP methods POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE are similar to CURD (create, update, read, delete) operations in the database. 
GET:
Get method is used to retrieve or get the information from the given server using a given URL. In REST CURD, it performs the read operation.
POST:
The Post Method is used for sending data to the server such as uploading a file or transferring some data or adding a new row to the back end table to any kind of web form. In a simple sentence, we can say that the post method is used for inserting new items in the backend server. In REST CRUD operation it performs the create operation.
