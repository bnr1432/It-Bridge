CSS - Cascading style sheet

        There are three main ways to include CSS:

Inline CSS:-
Definition: CSS styles are applied directly to HTML elements using the style attribute.
Best For: Quick, one-time styles or testing.
Drawback: Not reusable and makes the HTML cluttered.
Ex:-
<h1 style="color: blue; font-size: 24px;">Welcome to My Website!</h1>

Internal CSS (Embedded CSS):-
Definition: CSS is included within the <style> tag inside the <head> section of the HTML document.
Best For: Styling a single HTML page.
Drawback: Cannot be reused across multiple pages.
Ex:-
<head>
    <title>Internal CSS Example</title>
    <style>
        body {
            background-color: #f0f0f0;
        }
        h1 {
            color: green;
        }
    </style>
</head>

External CSS:-
Definition: CSS is written in a separate .css file, which is linked to HTML using the <link> tag.
Best For: Large websites with multiple pages.
Drawback: Requires an additional file but keeps HTML clean and reusable.

Ex:-
<head>
    <title>External CSS Example</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>

style.css
body {
    background-color: #f0f0f0;
}
h1 {
    color: red;
}

Note : we can use custom tag also in html and also we can apply css to that tag also.
custom tag is not predefined tag user can create own tag.
ex:
<high> hello</high>

high{
        color: white;
}

text-align -
text-indent - 
text-decoration - 
text-transform - all letter will be captialize ,uppercase,lowercase
font-family -
font-style - 
font-size -
background-image - 
background-repeat - 

Rule in anchor tag:
a:visted
a:link
a:hover

We can give two tags at same time use css

External Css : Maintainance
Help us in reusing the style in other HTML Files
The benfit is we can reuse that css file

 ---CSS Selectors--- 
COMMAND	                                    DESCRIPTION	                                                       SYNTAX

UNIVERSAL SELECTOR	                The CSS universal selector (*) matches elements of any type.                 {}
                                    When utilising @namespace, universal selectors
                                    can be namespaced.	

ID SELECTOR	                        The CSS ID selector matches an element based on the value of                 #id {}
                                    the elementâ€™s id attribute. This is what you'd use to refer 
                                    to that one-of-a-kind element with an id.	

CLASS SELECTOR	                    The CSS class selector matches elements based on the contents               .class {}
                                    of their class. 	

TYPE SELECTOR	                    It selects all elements of the given type within a document.                h1, h2 ,h3 {}
                                    In other words, the type selector in CSS matches components 
                                    based on their node names.	

ADJACENT SIBLING SELECTOR	        The adjacent sibling combinator (+) separates two selectors.                 h1 + p {}
                                    It comes right after the first element, and they're both children  
                                    of the same parent.	

CHILD SELECTOR	                    The child combinator (>) is placed between two CSS selectors.	            ul > li {}

GENERAL SIBLING SELECTOR	        Select all elements that follow the first element such that both            h1 ~ p {}
                                    are children of the same parent.

DESCENDANT SELECTOR	                Any selector with white space between two selectors without a               p a {}
                                    combinator.	

Declarations:

    h1{ color : blue; font-style : 20px;}
